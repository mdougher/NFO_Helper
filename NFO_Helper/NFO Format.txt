Plex (appears) to read NFO files from the same format as XBMC/Kodi.

From this link: 
http://kodi.wiki/view/NFO_files/movies
here is the XML format for all possible tags. Not all of them really apply, and others are not needed for my usage.
We may want to extend the NFO object to use some more of these tags later.

    <movie>
        <title>Who knows</title>
        <originaltitle>Who knows for real</originaltitle>
        <sorttitle>Who knows 1</sorttitle>
        <set>Who knows trilogy</set>
        <rating>6.100000</rating>
        <year>2008</year>
        <top250>0</top250>

        <outline>A look at the role of the Buckeye State in the 2004 Presidential Election.</outline><!-- Should be short, will be displayed on a single line. -->
        <plot>A look at the role of the Buckeye State in the 2004 Presidential Election.</plot> <!-- Can contain more information on multiple lines, will be wrapped. -->
        <tagline></tagline>

        <fileinfo>
            <streamdetails> <!-- While it is possible to manually set the information contained within the "streamdetails" tag,there is little point in doing so, as the software will always overwrite this data when it plays back the video file. In other words, no matter how many times you try to manually set it, it will be undone the moment the video is played.-->
