To Do List: (TBD:)

For Future Release(s)
* display NFO data in a more editable way, in case some of the results are not desired, but just for this result.
* add a 'release notes' section to the About form.
* NFO properties should be ordered. That is, the first item present in the will be the first XML tag to appear.
*	NFO Filter will need to be updated as well.
*	this means the FilterForm will need [up] and [down] buttons to move them up and down, as we can't just sort alphabetically.
* if the NFO contains a 'thumb', do not allow user to change the image. the controls should be replaced with something to indicate this.

For Soon:
* show an 'error' image if there are no posters available, or if we fail to get one.
* customizable NFO filters some kind of new form. let the user define them, save to file & read it when needed.
