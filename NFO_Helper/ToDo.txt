To Do List: (TBD:)

For Future Release(s)
* display NFO data in a more editable way.
* customizable NFO filters some kind of new form. let the user define them, save to file & read it when needed.
* add a 'release notes' section to the About form.
* add more providers for movie data (IMDb, what else?)

For Soon:
* show an 'error' image if there are no posters available, or if we fail to get one.

code improvements:
* what other things should be disposed?
