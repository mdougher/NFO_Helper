To Do List: (TBD:)

For Future Release(s)
* display NFO data in a more editable way.
* customizable NFO filters some kind of new form. let the user define them, save to file & read it when needed.
* add a 'release notes' section to the About form.

For Soon:
* show an 'error' image if there are no posters available, or if we fail to get one.
* implement a stale timeout for url cache.
* put everything into GIT or sourceforge (?)

code improvements:
* wrap things in using statements for disposal. see: httphelpers.
* what other things should be disposed?
* implement iDisposable in my objects?
* catch JSON exceptions when deserializing. 
* when a TMDb API call fails in the 'get nfo data' loop, break from loop. otherwise we will likely repeatedly call the APIs and fail over and over.
	say, if bad api-key is present.
